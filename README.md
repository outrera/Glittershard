# Glittershard's End

Welcome to the realm of Glittershard, a world of magic and stabbing things with swords!

**What is this thing?**

Glittershard's End is an RPG largely inspired by DND. It's going to have lots of races, 30-ish classes, tons of spells, and adventure!

**Features:**

*Single Player:* A single player campaign that allows you to be who you want to be, say what you want to say, just like those old text adventure games! **EXACTLY** like those old text adventure games!

*Multiplayer:* Online play, either DMed or in some sort of multiplayer campaign.

*Terminals!* The game is played in terminal, because I suck at sprites. Also, it worked for Dwarf Fortress.

**Requirements:**

A terminal, and I guess a toaster or something that can run said terminal. Seriously, I'm making a MintyPi just so I can play this wherever.

I'm using the Ubuntu xterm as my dev environment, which supports colors and changing colors, though my goal is to not need colors in the finished project. Colors are just a bonus.
