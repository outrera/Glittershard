***Glittershard’s End - Technical manual***
===========================================

-------------------------
Glittershard’s End uses the D20 system, so you will need 1 d20, 1 d12, 1
d10, 1 percentile, 1 d8, 1 d6, and 1 d4 to be able to play, along with a

**Creating a character:**
To create a character, Several things should be decided up front:
- Race
- Gender
- Class
- Name
- Alignment
- Stats
- Age
Gender, Alignment, Age and Name help come up with a character.

**Proccedure:**
- Stats, Race, and Class are important to a character mechanically. Any of the three can be chosen first, depending on how you would like to build the character.
- Once all three are chosen or rolled, write down Stats with any bonuses from Race
- Write down Size and Speed
- Write down Traits given by Race
- Write down 1st level perks
- Write down 2 additional things to train in
- Calculate and write down Max HP
- Calculate Max Magical Stamina

- Write down how much gold your class grants you and items granted by class
- Write down Max carry weight.
- Write down Armor in the “body” slot under armor or wearables, and write armor rating in the Rested State section.
- Calculate Dodge
- Calculate Melee and Ranged weapons accuracy and damage
- If your character is magical, pick spells as appropriate.

***Events***
-------------
**Combat** is started any time two parties are intent on using violence on one another.
When combat is started, each character rolls a d20 and adds their Dex. This is their initiative.
Highest number goes first, and higher Dex goes first in event of a tie.
Tie breaker from there is Sur. Further ties are determined by dice roll.
Each person gets four actions on their turn: 1 attack, 1 move, 2 small actions
Each round of combat lasts ten seconds real time.
Combat ends when one side is defeated (Dead, unconscious, ran away)

**Skill challenges** start the same, but instead of enemies, it’s PVE.
Get initiatives, and creatively try to get around an obstacle using skills instead of attacks. You need to succeed a certain number of times before you fail a certain amount of times

***Actions***
-------------
**Action Hierarchy:** In combat there are four types of actions that can be taken:
Attack: Use a weapon against a foe
Move: Move to a new unit on the board
Small: Small actions are ones like loading crossbows, getting potions out of hip bags, switching weapons.
Slow Attack: Consumes both Move and Attack action
Attacks can be traded in for moves, and moves can be traded in for small actions.

**Attack Actions**
- Most Spells, unless stated otherwise
- Melee and Ranged attacks
- Shoving
- Can be traded down to double Movement.

**Move Actions**
- Moving
- Kick away
- Climbing
- Crawling
- Standing up
- In-combat skill checks (Breaking free from a binding)
- Can be traded down for 1 small action per 3 units

**Small actions**
- Drawing or replacing a weapon from a holster or bag
- Drawing or replacing an item from a holster or bag
- Drinking a potion
- Loading a crossbow
- Force Feed
- Grabbing an item off the ground

**Casting Magic:** Casting most magical spells cost an Attack action.

**Climbing:** An entity can climb a surface with a bonus equal to Str + Dex. The challenge of the slope is determined by material and angle. Challenge rating is how many units of movement it costs to move one unit, minimum of 1 (flat ground)

**Crawling:** When knocked down, movement speed is reduced to 2 units. Standing up takes 3 units of movement to complete. All attacks made while down take a -10 penalty to accuracy, and dodge takes a -10 point penalty.

**Disarm:** People can be disarmed. Weapons fall to the ground, and can be picked up with a small action.

**Force Feed:** You can feed or splash a potion to an unconscious or willing participant with a small action. Must be in melee range. An unwilling target requires an attack to feed the potion.

**Kick away:** 3 Units of a move action can be used to knock a weapon on the ground away. The rest of an entities' movement may still be used.

**Melee:** Melee attacks are attacks with short (5 ft) range.
Attack: Str + Weapon accuracy + 1d20
Hit: Str + Weapon damage

**Movement Speed:** The number of units an entity can move in one turn
Movement speed = 6 + ½ Dex

**Ranged:** Ranged weapons are weapons that can attack at distances greater than arm’s reach. These generally include bows, crossbows, thrown daggers, Etc. Weapon determines accuracy, damage ratings, range, ammunition type, loading times.
Attack: Dex + weapon accuracy + 1d20
Hit: Dex + Weapon damage
Bows require one small action to draw an arrow, and one small action to get an arrow unless arrow is in a quiver.
Crossbows require one small actions to load a bolt, one small action to tension the string, and one small action to retrieve a bolt if not in a quiver. Crossbows can be pre-tensioned before battle, but cannot be kept that way for a long rest.

**Rest:** Rest is when a creature is asleep or taking a break from the action.
A long rest requires sleep for six hours within an eight hour period. Cannot sleep more than once every twelve hours.
A short rest is a fifteen minute break where no Events happen, which allows "Once per combat" actions to refresh.

**Shove:** An entity may be shoved 2 units on a successful shove, away from the shoving entity.

**Slow Attack:**
A special type of action that consumes both the Attack action and the Move action

**Unit:** A unit is 5 ft x 5 ft x 5 ft.
