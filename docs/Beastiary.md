***Glittershard’s End - Bestiary***
===================================

***How to use this guide***
---------------------------
This document details the stats and traits of all the creatures of Glittershard.

It contains all the information specific to one race, be it Human, Dragon, or Skeleton. It  also includes every effect like poison and sleep deprivation.

***Stats:***
------------
Stats start at 0. 0 is considered average for a human. All creatures have 0's for all stats initially, adding whatever bonuses their race gets them

The 8 stats are:

| Strength (Str)   | Health (Hea)       | Dexterity (Dex)   | Charm (Cha)
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------
| Wit (Wit)        | Light magic (LM)   | Dark magic (DM)   | Survival (Sur)

To assign stat scores, take one +4, one +3, two +2’s, two +1’s, a 0, and a -1 and assign one to each score. Or, roll 8d6 and subtract two from all rolls to create a new array. If total of all post-subtraction dice is less than 8, re-roll.

**HP (Hit Points):** A measure of how healthy you are. If these fall below 0, an entity falls unconscious. If twice the maximum number of HP of damage is incurred, the entity dies outright.
Level 1 Max HP = Race base health + 3 \* Hea
A long rest resets HP to it's max for that creature.

**Dodge:** The chance an attack will miss altogether. Negative dodge does not have any effect.
Dodge = 20 - size penalty - armor penalty + Dex

- -1 Cha: Undead creatures are generally not as cute and smell worse than their living counterparts.
- HP is halved: Undead are barely clinging to life
- Damage is doubled: Necrotic energies seep out and hurt anyone who is damaged by the creature
- Unsleeping: 

**Non-sapient Undead:** When a Lich, Vampire, Wight or Zombie is resurrected imperfectly, they come back without minds. They instead act on their insatiable hunger unless controlled by a necromantic practitioner.

**Natural Weapons:** Some entities cannot hold weapons, but have claws or beaks or horns.

***Effects***
-------------
**Charm:** While charmed, an entity is not in control of its actions. Instead, the charmer is in control. Charm can only take effect on sapient entities not already under someone’s control, and the target must be of the opposite gender or suffer a -1 penalty to have the charm take effect.
1d20 + Cha vs 1d20 + Judgement

**Fall damage:** When something falls, it takes 1d6 damage per unit fallen.

**Fear:** Target of fear loses attack action for 10 seconds. 1d20 + Speechcraft vs 1d20 + Judgement

**Infection:**
| Name         | Description
| ------------ | -----------------------------------------
| Vampireism   | Give the vampirism trait to the victim.
|              | 
|              |   
|              |   

**Invisibile:** While invisible, an entity cannot be seen. They are still physical, can make noise, and be attacked by creatures with Enhanced senses.

**Hunger:** When a creature misses a meal, it becomes hungry. There are four stages of hunger:
0-4 hours: -1 Move speed
4-16 hours: -1 Str
48-192 hours: Health does not come back after a long rest
192+ hours: Creature starves to death

**Paralyzed:** A paralyzed entity cannot move or take actions. Refer to the cause of effect for exit condition

**Poisoned:** Poisons cause damage over time. A heal check of poison level + 1d10 (rolled when poison is applied) can be passed to get rid of the poison.

**Sleep Deprivation:** If not long rest is taken in a 48 hour period, all stats fall by 1 per 48 hours unrested. Stats reset when a long rest is taken.

**Summoned:** Summoned creatures exist separate from the controlling entity. The summons have their own stats, and share the actions of their controller.

**Vampirism:** This disease causes the entity to need to suck blood from a natural or fey creature every 24 hours or suffer -1 penalty to all stats. If one target is drained three days in a row, that entity becomes a zombie.
If creature is elegible to become a vampire and the vampirism is not removed within a week, creature become vampire in full.
